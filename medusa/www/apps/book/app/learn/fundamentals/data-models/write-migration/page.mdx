In this chapter, you'll learn what a migration is and how to generate a migration or write it manually.

## What is a Migration?

A migration is a TypeScript or JavaScript file that defines database changes made by a module. Migrations are useful when you re-use a module or you're working in a team, so that when one member of a team makes a database change, everyone else can reflect it on their side by running the migrations.

The migration's file has a class with two methods:

- The `up` method reflects changes on the database.
- The `down` method reverts the changes made in the `up` method.

---

## Generate Migration

Instead of you writing the migration manually, the Medusa CLI tool provides a [db:generate](!resources!/medusa-cli/commands/db#dbgenerate) command to generate a migration for a modules' data models.

For example, assuming you have a `blog` Module, you can generate a migration for it by running the following command:

```bash
npx medusa db:generate blog
```

This generates a migration file under the `migrations` directory of the Blog Module. You can then run it to reflect the changes in the database as mentioned in [this section](#run-the-migration).

---

## Write a Migration Manually

You can also write migrations manually. To do that, create a file in the `migrations` directory of the module and in it, a class that has an `up` and `down` method. The class's name should be of the format `Migration{YEAR}{MONTH}{DAY}{HOUR}{MINUTE}.ts` to ensure migrations are ran in the correct order.

For example:

```ts title="src/modules/blog/migrations/Migration202507021059.ts"
import { Migration } from "@mikro-orm/migrations"

export class Migration202507021059 extends Migration {

  async up(): Promise<void> {
    this.addSql("create table if not exists \"author\" (\"id\" text not null, \"name\" text not null, \"created_at\" timestamptz not null default now(), \"updated_at\" timestamptz not null default now(), \"deleted_at\" timestamptz null, constraint \"author_pkey\" primary key (\"id\"));")
  }

  async down(): Promise<void> {
    this.addSql("drop table if exists \"author\" cascade;")
  }

}
```

The migration class in the file extends the `Migration` class imported from `@mikro-orm/migrations`. In the `up` and `down` method of the migration class, you use the `addSql` method provided by MikroORM's `Migration` class to run PostgreSQL syntax.

In the example above, the `up` method creates the table `author`, and the `down` method drops the table if the migration is reverted.

<Note title="Tip">

Refer to [MikroORM's documentation](https://mikro-orm.io/docs/migrations#migration-class) for more details on writing migrations.

## Run the Migration

To run your migration, run the following command:

<Note>

This command also syncs module links. If you don't want that, use the `--skip-links` option.

</Note>

```bash
npx medusa db:migrate
```

This reflects the changes in the database as implemented in the migration's `up` method.

---

## Rollback the Migration

To rollback or revert the last migration you ran for a module, run the following command:

```bash
npx medusa db:rollback blog
```

This rolls back the last ran migration on the Blog Module.

### Caution: Rollback Migration before Deleting

If you need to delete a migration file, make sure to rollback the migration first. Otherwise, you might encounter issues when generating and running new migrations.

For example, if you delete the migration of the Blog Module, then try to create a new one, Medusa will create a brand new migration that re-creates the tables or indices. If those are still in the database, you might encounter errors.

So, always rollback the migration before deleting it.
