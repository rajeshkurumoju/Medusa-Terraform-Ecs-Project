In this chapter, you’ll learn about Query and how to use it to fetch data from modules.

## What is Query?

Query fetches data across modules. It’s a set of methods registered in the Medusa container under the `query` key.

In all resources that can access the [Medusa Container](../../medusa-container/page.mdx), such as API routes or workflows, you can resolve Query to fetch data across custom modules and Medusa’s commerce modules.

---

## Query Example

For example, create the route `src/api/query/route.ts` with the following content:

export const exampleHighlights = [
  ["13", "", "Resolve Query from the Medusa container."],
  ["15", "graph", "Run a query to retrieve data."],
  ["16", "entity", "The name of the data model you're querying."],
  ["17", "fields", "An array of the data model’s properties to retrieve in the result."],
]

```ts title="src/api/query/route.ts" highlights={exampleHighlights} collapsibleLines="1-8" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import {
  MedusaRequest,
  MedusaResponse,
} from "@medusajs/framework/http"
import {
  ContainerRegistrationKeys,
} from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

export const GET = async (
  req: MedusaRequest,
  res: MedusaResponse
) => {
  const query = req.scope.resolve(ContainerRegistrationKeys.QUERY)

  const { data: posts } = await query.graph({
    entity: "post",
    fields: ["id", "title"],
  })

  res.json({ posts })
}
```

In the above example, you resolve Query from the Medusa container using the `ContainerRegistrationKeys.QUERY` (`query`) key.

Then, you run a query using its `graph` method. This method accepts as a parameter an object with the following required properties:

- `entity`: The data model's name, as specified in the first parameter of the `model.define` method used for the data model's definition.
- `fields`: An array of the data model’s properties to retrieve in the result.

The method returns an object that has a `data` property, which holds an array of the retrieved data. For example:

```json title="Returned Data"
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "123",
      "title": "My Post"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Querying the Graph

When you use the `query.graph` method, you're running a query through an internal graph that the Medusa application creates.

This graph collects data models of all modules in your application, including commerce and custom modules, and identifies relations and links between them.

---

## Retrieve Linked Records

Retrieve the records of a linked data model by passing in `fields` the data model's name suffixed with `.*`.

For example:

```ts highlights={[["6"]]}
const { data: posts } = await query.graph({
  entity: "post",
  fields: [
    "id", 
    "title",
    "product.*",
  ],
})
```

`.*` means that all of data model's properties should be retrieved. You can also retrieve specific properties by replacing the `*` with the property name, for each property.

For example:

```ts
const { data: posts } = await query.graph({
  entity: "post",
  fields: [
    "id", 
    "title",
    "product.id",
    "product.title",
  ],
})
```

In the example above, you retrieve only the `id` and `title` properties of the `product` linked to a `post`.

### Retrieve List Link Records

If the linked data model has `isList` enabled in the link definition, pass in `fields` the data model's plural name suffixed with `.*`.

For example:

```ts highlights={[["6"]]}
const { data: posts } = await query.graph({
  entity: "post",
  fields: [
    "id", 
    "title",
    "products.*",
  ],
})
```

In the example above, you retrieve all products linked to a post.

### Apply Filters and Pagination on Linked Records

Consider you want to apply filters or pagination configurations on the product(s) linked to `post`. To do that, you must query the module link's table instead.

As mentioned in the [Module Link](../page.mdx) documentation, Medusa creates a table for your module link. So, not only can you retrieve linked records, but you can also retrieve the records in a module link's table.

A module link's definition, exported by a file under `src/links`, has a special `entryPoint` property. Use this property when specifying the `entity` property in Query's `graph` method.

For example:

export const queryLinkTableHighlights = [
  ["1", "", "Import the module link."],
  ["6", "ProductPostLink.entryPoint", "Pass the `entryPoint` property of the link to Query"],
  ["7", `"product.*"`, "Retrieve the fields of a product record linked to a `Post` record."],
  ["7", `"post.*"`, "Retrieve the fields of a `Post` record linked to a product record."]
]

```ts highlights={queryLinkTableHighlights}
import ProductPostLink from "../../../links/product-post"

// ...

const { data: productCustoms } = await query.graph({
  entity: ProductPostLink.entryPoint,
  fields: ["*", "product.*", "post.*"],
  pagination: {
    take: 5,
    skip: 0,
  },
})
```

In the object passed to the `graph` method:

- You pass the `entryPoint` property of the link definition as the value for `entity`. So, Query will retrieve records from the module link's table.
- You pass three items to the `field` property:
    - `*` to retrieve the link table's fields. This is useful if the link table has [custom columns](../custom-columns/page.mdx).
    - `product.*` to retrieve the fields of a product record linked to a `Post` record.
    - `post.*` to retrieve the fields of a `Post` record linked to a product record.

You can then apply any [filters](#apply-filters) or [pagination configurations](#apply-pagination).

The returned `data` is similar to the following:

```json title="Example Result"
[{
  "id": "123",
  "product_id": "prod_123",
  "post_id": "123",
  "product": {
    "id": "prod_123",
    // other product fields...
  },
  "post": {
    "id": "123",
    // other post fields...
  }
}]
```

---

## Apply Filters

```ts highlights={[["4"], ["5"], ["6"]]}
const { data: posts } = await query.graph({
  entity: "post",
  fields: ["id", "title"],
  filters: {
    id: "post_123",
  },
})
```

The `query.graph` function accepts a `filters` property. You can use this property to filter retrieved records.

In the example above, you filter the `post` records by the ID `post_123`.

You can also filter by multiple values of a property. For example:

```ts highlights={[["4"], ["5"], ["6"], ["7"], ["8"], ["9"]]}
const { data: posts } = await query.graph({
  entity: "post",
  fields: ["id", "title"],
  filters: {
    id: [
      "post_123",
      "post_321",
    ],
  },
})
```

In the example above, you filter the `post` records by multiple IDs.

<Note>

Filters don't apply on fields of linked data models from other modules. Refer to the [Retrieve Linked Records](#retrieve-linked-records) section for an alternative solution.

</Note>

### Advanced Query Filters

Under the hood, Query uses the `listX` (`listPosts`) method of the data model's module's service to retrieve records. This method accepts a filter object that can be used to filter records.

Those filters don't just allow you to filter by exact values. You can also filter by properties that don't match a value, match multiple values, and other filter types.

Refer to the [Service Factory Reference](!resources!/service-factory-reference/tips/filtering) for examples of advanced filters. The following sections provide some quick examples.

#### Filter by Not Matching a Value

```ts highlights={[["4"], ["5"], ["6"], ["7"], ["8"]]}
const { data: posts } = await query.graph({
  entity: "post",
  fields: ["id", "title"],
  filters: {
    title: {
      $ne: null,
    },
  },
})
```

In the example above, only posts that have a title are retrieved.

#### Filter by Not Matching Multiple Values

```ts highlights={[["4"], ["5"], ["6"], ["7"], ["8"]]}
const { data: posts } = await query.graph({
  entity: "post",
  fields: ["id", "title"],
  filters: {
    title: {
      $nin: ["My Post", "Another Post"],
    },
  },
})
```

In the example above, only posts that don't have the title `My Post` or `Another Post` are retrieved.

#### Filter by a Range

```ts highlights={[["10"], ["11"], ["12"], ["13"], ["14"], ["15"]]}
const startToday = new Date()
startToday.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0)

const endToday = new Date()
endToday.setHours(23, 59, 59, 59)

const { data: posts } = await query.graph({
  entity: "post",
  fields: ["id", "title"],
  filters: {
    published_at: {
      $gt: startToday,
      $lt: endToday,
    },
  },
})
```

In the example above, only posts that were published today are retrieved.

#### Filter Text by Like Value

<Note>

This filter only applies to text-like properties, including `text`, `id`, and `enum` properties.

</Note>

```ts highlights={[["4"], ["5"], ["6"], ["7"], ["8"]]}
const { data: posts } = await query.graph({
  entity: "post",
  fields: ["id", "title"],
  filters: {
    title: {
      $like: "%My%",
    },
  },
})
```

In the example above, only posts that have the word `My` in their title are retrieved.

#### Filter a Relation's Property

```ts highlights={[["4"], ["5"], ["6"], ["7"], ["8"]]}
const { data: posts } = await query.graph({
  entity: "post",
  fields: ["id", "title"],
  filters: {
    author: {
      name: "John",
    },
  },
})
```

While it's not possible to filter by a linked data model's property, you can filter by a relation's property (that is, the property of a related data model that is defined in the same module).

In the example above, only posts that have an author with the name `John` are retrieved.

---

## Apply Pagination

```ts highlights={[["8", "skip", "The number of records to skip before fetching the results."], ["9", "take", "The number of records to fetch."]]}
const { 
  data: posts,
  metadata: { count, take, skip } = {},
} = await query.graph({
  entity: "post",
  fields: ["id", "title"],
  pagination: {
    skip: 0,
    take: 10,
  },
})
```

The `graph` method's object parameter accepts a `pagination` property to configure the pagination of retrieved records.

To paginate the returned records, pass the following properties to `pagination`:

- `skip`: (required to apply pagination) The number of records to skip before fetching the results.
- `take`: The number of records to fetch.

When you provide the pagination fields, the `query.graph` method's returned object has a `metadata` property. Its value is an object having the following properties:

<TypeList types={[
  {
    name: "skip",
    type: "`number`",
    description: "The number of records skipped."
  },
  {
    name: "take",
    type: "`number`",
    description: "The number of records requested to fetch."
  },
  {
    name: "count",
    type: "`number`",
    description: "The total number of records."
  }
]} sectionTitle="Apply Pagination" />

### Sort Records

```ts highlights={[["5"], ["6"], ["7"]]}
const { data: posts } = await query.graph({
  entity: "post",
  fields: ["id", "title"],
  pagination: {
    order: {
      name: "DESC",
    },
  },
})
```

<Note>

Sorting doesn't work on fields of linked data models from other modules.

</Note>

To sort returned records, pass an `order` property to `pagination`.

The `order` property is an object whose keys are property names, and values are either:

- `ASC` to sort records by that property in ascending order.
- `DESC` to sort records by that property in descending order.

---

## Configure Query to Throw Errors

By default, if Query doesn't find records matching your query, it returns an empty array. You can add option to configure Query to throw an error when no records are found.

The `query.graph` method accepts as a second parameter an object that can have a `throwIfKeyNotFound` property. Its value is a boolean indicating whether to throw an error if no record is found when filtering by IDs. By default, it's `false`.

For example:

```ts
const { data: posts } = await query.graph({
  entity: "post",
  fields: ["id", "title"],
  filters: {
    id: "post_123",
  },
}, {
  throwIfKeyNotFound: true,
})
```

In the example above, if no post is found with the ID `post_123`, Query will throw an error. This is useful to stop execution when a record is expected to exist.

### Throw Error on Related Data Model

The `throwIfKeyNotFound` option can also be used to throw an error if the ID of a related data model's record (in the same module) is passed in the filters, and the related record doesn't exist.

For example:

```ts
const { data: posts } = await query.graph({
  entity: "post",
  fields: ["id", "title", "author.*"],
  filters: {
    id: "post_123",
    author_id: "author_123",
  },
}, {
  throwIfKeyNotFound: true,
})
```

In the example above, Query throws an error either if no post is found with the ID `post_123` or if its found but its author ID isn't `author_123`.

In the above example, it's assumed that a post belongs to an author, so it has an `author_id` property. However, this also works in the opposite case, where an author has many posts.

For example:

```ts
const { data: posts } = await query.graph({
  entity: "author",
  fields: ["id", "name", "posts.*"],
  filters: {
    id: "author_123",
    posts: {
      id: "post_123",
    },
  },
}, {
  throwIfKeyNotFound: true,
})
```

In the example above, Query throws an error if no author is found with the ID `author_123` or if the author is found but doesn't have a post with the ID `post_123`.

## Request Query Configurations

For API routes that retrieve a single or list of resources, Medusa provides a `validateAndTransformQuery` middleware that:

- Validates accepted query parameters, as explained in [this documentation](../../../fundamentals/api-routes/validation/page.mdx).
- Parses configurations that are received as query parameters to be passed to Query.

Using this middleware allows you to have default configurations for retrieved fields and relations or pagination, while allowing clients to customize them per request.

### Step 1: Add Middleware

The first step is to use the `validateAndTransformQuery` middleware on the `GET` route. You add the middleware in `src/api/middlewares.ts`:

```ts title="src/api/middlewares.ts"
import { 
  validateAndTransformQuery,
  defineMiddlewares,
} from "@medusajs/framework/http"
import { createFindParams } from "@medusajs/medusa/api/utils/validators"

export const GetCustomSchema = createFindParams()

export default defineMiddlewares({
  routes: [
    {
      matcher: "/customs",
      method: "GET",
      middlewares: [
        validateAndTransformQuery(
          GetCustomSchema,
          {
            defaults: [
              "id",
              "title",
              "products.*",
            ],
            isList: true,
          }
        ),
      ],
    },
  ],
})
```

The `validateAndTransformQuery` accepts two parameters:

1. A Zod validation schema for the query parameters, which you can learn more about in the [API Route Validation documentation](../../../fundamentals/api-routes/validation/page.mdx). Medusa has a `createFindParams` utility that generates a Zod schema that accepts four query parameters:
    1. `fields`: The fields and relations to retrieve in the returned resources.
    2. `offset`: The number of items to skip before retrieving the returned items.
    3. `limit`: The maximum number of items to return.
    4. `order`: The fields to order the returned items by in ascending or descending order.
2. A Query configuration object. It accepts the following properties:
    1. `defaults`: An array of default fields and relations to retrieve in each resource.
    2. `isList`: A boolean indicating whether a list of items are returned in the response.
    3. `allowed`: An array of fields and relations allowed to be passed in the `fields` query parameter.
    4. `defaultLimit`: A number indicating the default limit to use if no limit is provided. By default, it's `50`.

### Step 2: Use Configurations in API Route

After applying this middleware, your API route now accepts the `fields`, `offset`, `limit`, and `order` query parameters mentioned above.

The middleware transforms these parameters to configurations that you can pass to Query in your API route handler. These configurations are stored in the `queryConfig` parameter of the `MedusaRequest` object.

<Note>

As of [Medusa v2.2.0](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.2.0), `remoteQueryConfig` has been deprecated in favor of `queryConfig`. Their usage is still the same, only the property name has changed.

</Note>

For example, Create the file `src/api/customs/route.ts` with the following content:

export const queryConfigHighlights = [
  ["17", "req.queryConfig", "Pass the parsed request Query configurations to the Query graph execution."]
]

```ts title="src/api/customs/route.ts"
import {
  MedusaRequest,
  MedusaResponse,
} from "@medusajs/framework/http"
import {
  ContainerRegistrationKeys,
} from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

export const GET = async (
  req: MedusaRequest,
  res: MedusaResponse
) => {
  const query = req.scope.resolve(ContainerRegistrationKeys.QUERY)

  const { data: posts } = await query.graph({
    entity: "post",
    ...req.queryConfig,
  })

  res.json({ posts: posts })
}
```

This adds a `GET` API route at `/customs`, which is the API route you added the middleware for.

In the API route, you pass `req.queryConfig` to `query.graph`. `queryConfig` has properties like `fields` and `pagination` to configure the query based on the default values you specified in the middleware, and the query parameters passed in the request.

### Test it Out

To test it out, start your Medusa application and send a `GET` request to the `/customs` API route. A list of records are retrieved with the specified fields in the middleware.

```json title="Returned Data"
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "id": "123",
      "title": "test"
    }
  ]
}
```

Try passing one of the Query configuration parameters, like `fields` or `limit`, and you'll see its impact on the returned result.
