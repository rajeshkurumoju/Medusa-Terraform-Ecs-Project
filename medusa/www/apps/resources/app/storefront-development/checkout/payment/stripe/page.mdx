# {metadata.title}

In this guide, you'll learn how to use Stripe for payment during checkout in a React-based storefront.

<Note title="Tip">

For other types of frameworks or tech stacks, the steps are similar. Refer to [Stripe's documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/) for available tools for your tech stack.

## 1. Install Stripe SDK

In your storefront, use the following command to install Stripe's JS and React SDKs:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @stripe/react-stripe-js @stripe/stripe-js
```

---

## 2. Add Stripe Environment Variables

Next, add an environment variable holding your Stripe publishable API key.

For example:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PK=pk_test_51Kj...
```

<Note title="Tip">

For Next.js storefronts, the environment variable's name must be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC`. If your storefront's framework requires a different prefix, make sure to change it.

</Note>

## 3. Create Stripe Component

You can now create a Stripe component that renders the Stripe UI to accept payment.

For example, you can create a file holding the following Stripe component:

<Note title="Tip">

- This example uses the `useCart` hook defined in the [Cart React Context guide](../../../cart/context/page.mdx).
- Learn how to install and configure the JS SDK in the [JS SDK documentation](../../../../js-sdk/page.mdx).

```tsx highlights={highlights}
"use client"

import { 
  CardElement, 
  Elements, 
  useElements, 
  useStripe,
} from "@stripe/react-stripe-js"
import { loadStripe } from "@stripe/stripe-js"
import { useCart } from "@/providers/cart"
import { useState } from "react"
import { sdk } from "@/lib/sdk"

const stripe = loadStripe(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PK || "temp"
)

export default function StripePayment() {
  const { cart } = useCart()
  const clientSecret = cart?.payment_collection?.
    payment_sessions?.[0].data.client_secret as string

  return (
    <div>
      <Elements stripe={stripe} options={{
          clientSecret,
        }}>
        <StripeForm clientSecret={clientSecret} />
      </Elements>
    </div>
  )
}

const StripeForm = ({ 
  clientSecret,
}: {
  clientSecret: string | undefined
}) => {
  const { cart, refreshCart } = useCart()
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false)

  const stripe = useStripe()
  const elements = useElements()

  async function handlePayment(
    e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement, MouseEvent>
  ) {
    e.preventDefault()
    const card = elements?.getElement(CardElement)

    if (
      !stripe || 
      !elements ||
      !card ||
      !cart ||
      !clientSecret
    ) {
      return
    }

    setLoading(true)
    stripe?.confirmCardPayment(clientSecret, {
      payment_method: {
        card,
        billing_details: {
          name: cart.billing_address?.first_name,
          email: cart.email,
          phone: cart.billing_address?.phone,
          address: {
            city: cart.billing_address?.city,
            country: cart.billing_address?.country_code,
            line1: cart.billing_address?.address_1,
            line2: cart.billing_address?.address_2,
            postal_code: cart.billing_address?.postal_code,
          },
        },
      },
    })
    .then(({ error }) => {
      if (error) {
        // TODO handle errors
        console.error(error)
        return
      }

      sdk.store.cart.complete(cart.id)
      .then((data) => {
        if (data.type === "cart" && data.cart) {
          // an error occured
          console.error(data.error)
        } else if (data.type === "order" && data.order) {
          // TODO redirect to order success page
          alert("Order placed.")
          console.log(data.order)
          refreshCart()
        }
      })
    })
    .finally(() => setLoading(false))
  }

  return (
    <form>
      <CardElement />
      <button 
        onClick={handlePayment}
        disabled={loading}
      >
        Place Order
      </button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

In the code snippet above, you:

1. Create a `StripePayment` component that wraps the actual form with Stripe's `Elements` component.
    - In the `StripePayment` component, you obtain the client secret from the payment session's `data` field. This is set in the Medusa application after you initialize the payment session using the [Initialize Payment Sessions API route](!api!/store#payment-collections_postpaymentcollectionsidpaymentsessions).
2. Create a `StripeForm` component that holds the actual form. In this component, you implement a `handlePayment` function that does the following:
    - Use Stripe's `confirmCardPayment` method to accept the card details from the customer.
    - Once the customer enters their card details and submit their order, the resolution function of the `confirmCardPayment` method is executed.
    - In the resolution function, you send a request to the [Complete Cart API route](!api!/store#carts_postcartsidcomplete) to complete the cart and place the order.
    - In the received response of the request, if the `type` is `cart`, it means that the cart completion failed. The error is set in the `error` response field.
    - If the `type` is `order`, it means the card was completed and the order was placed successfully. You can access the order in the `order` response field.
    - When the order is placed, you refresh the cart. You can redirect the customer to an order success page at this point. The redirection logic depends on the framework you're using.

## 4. Use the Stripe Component

Finally, use the Stripe component in the checkout flow. You should render it after the customer chooses Stripe as a payment provider.

For example, you can use it in the `getPaymentUi` function defined in the [Payment Checkout Step guide](../page.mdx):

```tsx highlights={[["10"]]}
const getPaymentUi = useCallback(() => {
  const activePaymentSession = cart?.payment_collection?.
    payment_sessions?.[0]
  if (!activePaymentSession) {
    return
  }

  switch(true) {
    case activePaymentSession.provider_id.startsWith("pp_stripe_"):
      return <StripePayment />
    // ...
  }
} , [cart])
```
