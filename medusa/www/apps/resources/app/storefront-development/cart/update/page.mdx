In this guide, you'll learn how to update different details of a cart.

<Note title="Tip">

This guide doesn't cover updating the cart's line items. For that, refer to the [Manage Cart's Items in Storefront](../manage-items/page.mdx) guide.

</Note>

## Update Cart's Region

If a customer changes their region, you must update their cart to be associated with that region.

For example:

<Note title="Tip">

Learn how to install and configure the JS SDK in the [JS SDK documentation](../../../js-sdk/page.mdx).

</Note>

export const updateRegionHighlights = [
  ["2", `"new_id"`, "Pass the new chosen region's ID."]
]

```ts highlights={updateRegionHighlights}
sdk.store.cart.update(cartId, {
  region_id: "new_id",
})
.then(({ cart }) => {
  // use cart...
  console.log(cart)
})
```

The [Update Cart API route](!api!/store#carts_postcartsid) accepts a `region_id` request body parameter, whose value is the new region to associate with the cart.

## Set Cart's Customer

You might need to change the cart's customer in two cases:

- You created the cart for the customer as a guest, then they logged-in, so you want to associate the cart with them as a registered customer.
- You're transfering the cart from one customer to another, which is useful in company setups, such as when implementing B2B commerce applicatons.

To set or change the cart's customer, send an authenticated `POST` request to the Set Cart's Customer API route:

<Note>

This API route is only available after [Medusa v2.0.5](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.0.5).

</Note>

```ts
sdk.store.cart.transferCart(cartId)
.then(({ cart }) => {
  // use cart...
  console.log(cart)
})
```

Assuming the JS SDK is configured to send an authenticated request, the cart is now associated with the logged-in customer.

Learn more about authenticating customers with the JS SDK in the [Login Customer guide](../../customers/login/page.mdx).

<Note title="Tip">

When using the Fetch API to send the request, either use `credentials: include` if the customer is already authenticated with a cookie session, or pass the Authorization Bearer token in the request's header.
