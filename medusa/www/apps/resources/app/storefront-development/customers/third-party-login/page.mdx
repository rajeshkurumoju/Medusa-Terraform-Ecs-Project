# {metadata.title}

In this guide, you'll learn how to implement third-party or social login in your storefront. You'll implement the flow using Google as an example.

## Third-Party Login Flow in Storefront

Assuming you already set up the [Auth Module Provider](../../../commerce-modules/auth/auth-providers/page.mdx) in your Medusa application, you can login a customer with a third-party service, such as Google or GitHub, using the following flow:

![Diagram illustrating the authentication flow between the storefront, Medusa application, and the third-party service.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1725531068/Medusa%20Resources/Social_Media_Graphics_third-party-auth-customer_kfn3k3.jpg)

1. Authenticate the customer with the [Authenticate Customer API route](!api!/store#auth_postactor_typeauth_provider). It may return:
    - A URL in a `location` property to authenticate with third-party service, such as login with Google. When you receive this property, you must redirect to the returned location.
    - A token in a `token` property. In that case, the customer was previously logged in with the third-party service, such as Google, and no additional actions are required. You can use the token to send subsequent authenticated requests.
2. Once the authentication with the third-party service finishes, it must redirect back to the storefront with query parameters such as `code` and `state`. So, make sure your third-party service is configured to redirect to your storefront's callback page after successful authentication.
3. In the storefront's callback page, send a request to the [Validate Authentication Callback API route](!api!/store#auth_postactor_typeauth_providercallback) passing the query parameters (`code`, `state`, etc...) received from the third-party service.
4. If the callback validation is successful, you'll receive the authentication token. Decode the received token in the storefront using tools like [react-jwt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-jwt).
    - If the decoded data has an `actor_id` property, then the customer is already registered. So, use this token for subsequent authenticated requests.
    - If not, follow the rest of the steps.
5. The customer is not registered yet, so use the received token from the Validate Authentication Callback API route to create the customer using the [Create Customer API route](!api!/store#customers_postcustomers).
6. Send a request to the [Refresh Token Route](#add-the-function-to-refresh-the-token) to retrieve a new token for the customer, passing the token from the Validate Authentication Callback API in the header. You can then use the token returned by the Refresh Token request to send subsequent authenticated requests.

You'll implement the flow in this guide using Google as an example. The example snippets use the JS SDK, but you can follow a similar approach without it, as well.

## JS SDK Authentication Configuration

Before implementing the third-party login flow, you need to configure in the JS SDK the authentication method you're using in your storefront. This defines how the JS SDK will handle sending authenticated requests after the customer is authenticated.

Learn more about the authentication methods and how to configure them in the [Login Customer](../login/page.mdx) guide.

## Step 1: Authenticate Customer in Medusa

When the customer clicks on a "Login with Google" button, send a request to the [Authenticate Customer API route](!api!/store#auth_postactor_typeauth_provider).

For example:

<Note title="Tip">

Learn how to install and configure the JS SDK in the [JS SDK documentation](../../../js-sdk/page.mdx).

</Note>

<CodeTabs group="authenticated-request">
  <CodeTab label="React" value="react">
  
export const reactHighlights = [
  ["7", "login", "Send a request to the Authenticate Customer API route"],
  ["9", "result.location", "If the request returns a location, redirect to that location to continue the authentication."],
  ["16", "", "If the token isn't returned, the authentication has failed."],
  ["23", "retrieve", "Retrieve the customer's details as an example of testing authentication."]
]

```tsx highlights={reactHighlights}
"use client" // include with Next.js 13+

import { sdk } from "@/lib/sdk"

export default function Login() {
  const loginWithGoogle = async () => {
    const result = await sdk.auth.login("customer", "google", {})

    if (typeof result === "object" && result.location) {
      // redirect to Google for authentication
      window.location.href = result.location

      return
    }
    
    if (typeof result !== "string") {
      // result failed, show an error
      alert("Authentication failed")
      return
    }

    // all subsequent requests are authenticated
    const { customer } = await sdk.store.customer.retrieve()

    console.log(customer)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={loginWithGoogle}>Login with Google</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="JS SDK" value="js-sdk">
  
export const jsSdkHighlights = [
  ["2", "login", "Send a request to the Authenticate Customer API route"],
  ["4", "", "If the request returns a location, redirect to that location to continue the authentication."],
  ["11", "", "If the token isn't returned, the authentication has failed."],
  ["18", "retrieve", "Retrieve the customer's details as an example of testing authentication."]
]

```ts highlights={jsSdkHighlights}
const loginWithGoogle = async () => {
  const result = await sdk.auth.login("customer", "google", {})

  if (typeof result === "object" && result.location) {
    // redirect to Google for authentication
    window.location.href = result.location

    return
  }
  
  if (typeof result !== "string") {
    // result failed, show an error
    alert("Authentication failed")
    return
  }

  // all subsequent requests are authenticated
  const { customer } = await sdk.store.customer.retrieve()

  console.log(customer)
}
```

  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>

You define a `loginWithGoogle` function that:

- Sends a request to the `/auth/customer/google` API route using the JS SDK's `auth.login` method.
- If the response is an object with a `location` property, then you redirect to the returned page for authentication with the third-party service.
- If the response is a string, then the customer has been authenticated before and the method returns the customer's authentication token.
- Now, all subsequent requests are authenticated. As an example, you can retrieve the customer's details using the `store.customer.retrieve` method.
    - Notice that the JS SDK sets and passes the authentication headers or session cookies (based on your [configured authentication method](../../../js-sdk/auth/overview/page.mdx)) automatically. If you're not using the JS SDK, make sure to pass the necessary headers in your request as explained in the [API reference](!api!/store#authentication).

<Note title="Tip">

If you're using a provider other than Google, or if you've configured the Google provider with an ID other than `google`, replace `google` in the parameter `login("customer", "google", {})` with your provider ID.

</Note>

## Step 2: Callback Page in Storefront

In the previous step, you implemented as part of the login flow redirecting the customer to the third-party service for authentication.

Once the customer authenticates with the third-party service, the service redirects the customer back to your storefront with query parameters such as `code` and `state`.

The next step is to create the page in your storefront that the customer is redirected to after they authenticate with Google. You'll use this page's URL as the Redirect Uri in your Google settings, and set it in the `callbackUrl` of your [Google Auth Module Provider](../../../commerce-modules/auth/auth-providers/google/page.mdx)'s configurations.

<Note title="Tip">

The callback page is implemented step-by-step to explain the different parts of the flow. You can copy the full page code in the [Full Code Example for Third-Party Login Callback Page](#full-code-example-for-third-party-login-callback-page) section, and then add the functions one by one to test the flow.

</Note>

### Install the React-JWT Library

First, install the [react-jwt library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-jwt) in your storefront to use it for decoding the token received from Google:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install react-jwt
```

### Implement the Callback Page

Then, in a new page in your storefront that will be used as the callback / redirect uri destination, add the following:

<CodeTabs group="authenticated-request">
  <CodeTab label="React" value="react">
  
export const sendCallbackReactHighlights = [
  ["12", "queryParams", "The query parameters received from Google, such as `code` and `state`."],
  ["21", "callback", "Send a request to the Validate Authentication Callback API route"],
  ["28", "catch", "If an error occurs, show an alert and exit execution."],
]

```tsx highlights={sendCallbackReactHighlights}
"use client" // include with Next.js 13+

import { HttpTypes } from "@medusajs/types"
import { useEffect, useMemo, useState } from "react"
import { decodeToken } from "react-jwt"
import { sdk } from "@/lib/sdk"

export default function GoogleCallback() {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)
  const [customer, setCustomer] = useState<HttpTypes.StoreCustomer>()
  // for other than Next.js
  const queryParams = useMemo(() => {
    const searchParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)
    return Object.fromEntries(searchParams.entries())
  }, [])

  const sendCallback = async () => {
    let token = ""

    try {
      token = await sdk.auth.callback(
        "customer", 
        "google", 
        // pass all query parameters received from the
        // third party provider
        queryParams
      )
    } catch (error) {
      alert("Authentication Failed")
      
      throw error
    }

    return token
  }

  // TODO add more functions

  return (
    <div>
      {loading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {customer && <span>Created customer {customer.email} with Google.</span>}
    </div>
  )
}
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="JS SDK" value="js-sdk">
  
export const sendCallbackFetchHighlights = [
  ["6", "queryParams", "The query parameters received from Google, such as `code` and `state`."],
  ["12", "callback", "Send a request to the Validate Authentication Callback API route"],
  ["19", "catch", "If an error occurs, show an alert and exit execution."]
]

```ts highlights={sendCallbackFetchHighlights}
import { decodeToken } from "react-jwt"

// ...

const searchParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)
const queryParams = Object.fromEntries(searchParams.entries())

const sendCallback = async () => {
  let token = ""

  try {
    token = await sdk.auth.callback(
      "customer", 
      "google", 
      // pass all query parameters received from the
      // third party provider
      queryParams
    )
  } catch (error) {
    alert("Authentication Failed")
    
    throw error
  }

  return token
}

// TODO add more functions...
```

  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>

This adds in the new page the function `sendCallback` which sends a request to the [Validate Callback API route](!api!/store#auth_postactor_typeauth_providercallback), passing it all query parameters received from Google. Those include the `code` and `state` parameters.

Notice that the JS SDK stores the JWT token returned by the Validate Callback API route automatically and attaches it to subsequent requests. If you're building this authentication flow without the JS SDK, you need to pass it manually to the next requests.

### Add the Function to Create a Customer

Next, replace the `TODO` after the `sendCallback` function with the following:
  
export const createCustomerHighlights = [
  ["3", "create", "Create a customer"]
]

```ts highlights={createCustomerHighlights} title="JS SDK / React Applicable"
const createCustomer = async () => {
  // create customer
  await sdk.store.customer.create({
    email: "example@medusajs.com",
  })
}

// TODO add more functions...
```

This adds to the page the function `createCustomer` which creates a customer if this is the first time the customer is authenticating with the third-party service.

Notice that this method assumes that the token received from the [Validate Callback API route](!api!/store#auth_postactor_typeauth_providercallback) is already set in the JS SDK. So, if you're implemeting this flow without using the JS SDK, make sure to pass the token received from the [Validate Callback API route](!api!/store#auth_postactor_typeauth_providercallback) in the authorization Bearer header.

### Add the Function to Refresh the Token

Next, replace the new `TODO` with the following:
  
export const refreshTokenHighlights = [
  ["3", "refresh", "Fetch a new token for the created customer."]
]

```ts highlights={refreshTokenHighlights} title="JS SDK / React Applicable"
const refreshToken = async () => {
  // refresh the token
  const result = await sdk.auth.refresh()
}

// TODO add more functions...
```

This adds to the page the function `refreshToken` which is used after the new customer is created to refresh their authentication token. This ensures that the authentication token includes the details of the created customer.

Notice that this method assumes that the token received from the [Validate Callback API route](!api!/store#auth_postactor_typeauth_providercallback) is already set in the JS SDK. So, if you're implemeting this flow without using the JS SDK, make sure to pass the token in the authorization Bearer header.

The `refreshToken` method also updates the token stored by the JS SDK, ensuring that next requests use that token. So, if you're not using the JS SDK, make sure to pass the new token in the request header as explained in the [API reference](!api!/store#1-bearer-authorization-with-jwt-tokens).

### Add the Function to Validate the Callback

Finally, add in the place of the new `TODO` the `validateCallback` function that runs when the page first loads to validate the authentication:

<CodeTabs group="authenticated-request">
  <CodeTab label="React" value="react">
  
export const validateReactHighlights = [
  ["2", "sendCallback", "Validate the callback in Medusa and retrieve the authentication token"],
  ["4", "shouldCreateCustomer", "Check if the decoded token has an `actor_id` property to decide whether a customer to be created."],
  ["7", "createCustomer", "Create a customer if the decoded token doesn't have `actor_id`."],
  ["9", "refreshToken", "Fetch a new token for the created customer."],
  ["13", "retrieve", "Retrieve the customer's details as an example of testing authentication."]
]

```tsx highlights={validateReactHighlights}
const validateCallback = async () => {
  const token = await sendCallback()

  const shouldCreateCustomer = (decodeToken(token) as { actor_id: string }).actor_id === ""

  if (shouldCreateCustomer) {
    await createCustomer()

    await refreshToken()
  }

  // use token to send authenticated requests
  const { customer: customerData } =  await sdk.store.customer.retrieve()

  setCustomer(customerData)
  setLoading(false)
}


useEffect(() => {
  if (!loading) {
    return
  }

  validateCallback()
}, [loading])
```

  </CodeTab>
  <CodeTab label="JS SDK" value="js-sdk">
  
export const validateFetchHighlights = [
  ["2", "sendCallback", "Validate the callback in Medusa and retrieve the authentication token"],
  ["4", "shouldCreateCustomer", "Check if the decoded token has an `actor_id` property to decide whether a customer to be created."],
  ["7", "createCustomer", "Create a customer if the decoded token doesn't have `actor_id`."],
  ["9", "refreshToken", "Fetch a new token for the created customer."],
  ["13", "retrieve", "Retrieve the customer's details as an example of testing authentication."]
]

```ts highlights={validateFetchHighlights}
const validateCallback = async () => {
  const token = await sendCallback()

  const shouldCreateCustomer = (decodeToken(token) as { actor_id: string }).actor_id === ""

  if (shouldCreateCustomer) {
    await createCustomer()

    await refreshToken()
  }

  // use token to send authenticated requests
  const { customer: customerData } =  await sdk.store.customer.retrieve()

  setCustomer(customerData)
  setLoading(false)
}
```

  </CodeTab>
</CodeTabs>

The `validateCallback` function uses the functions added earlier to:

1. Send a request to the [Validate Callback API route](!api!/store#auth_postactor_typeauth_providercallback), which returns an authentication token.
    - The `sendCallback` function also sets the token in the JS SDK to be passed in subsequent requests.
2. Decodes the token to check if it has an `actor_id` property.
  - If so, then the customer is previously registered, and the authentication token can be used for subsequent authenticated requests.
  - If not, this is the first time the customer is authenticating with the third-party service, so:
      1. Create a customer using the [Create Customer API route](!api!/store#customers_postcustomers).
      2. Refetch the customer's authentication token after it's created using the [Refresh Token API route](!api!/store#auth_postactor_typeauth_providerrefresh).
      3. Use the token for subsequent authenticated requests.
3. Retrieve the customer's details as an example of testing authentication.

The customer is now authenticated, and you can redirect them to the home page or the page they were trying to access before logging in.
