# {metadata.title}

In this guide, you'll learn how to list product collections in the storefront, including paginating and filtering them.

<Note title="Good to know">

Product collections allow you to group products together for marketing or promotional purposes. For example, you can have a "Summer Clothes" collection grouping together all products that are suitable for the summer season. Then, you can display this collection in the summer to promote your summer collection.

## List Product Collections

To retrieve the list of product collections, send a request to the [List Product Collections API route](!api!/store#collections_getcollections):

    }, [loading])

    return (
      <div>
        {loading && <span>Loading...</span>}
        {!loading && collections.length === 0 && (
          <span>No product collections found.</span>
        )}
        {!loading && collections.length > 0 && (
          <ul>
            {collections.map((collection) => (
              <li key={collection.id}>{collection.title}</li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        )}

  ```

In this example, you retrieve the list of product collections by sending a request to the [List Product Collections API route](!api!/store#collections_getcollections).

The response has a `collections` field, which is an array of [product collections](!api!/store#collections_getcollections).

## Paginate Product Collections

To paginate product collections, pass the following query parameters to the [List Product Collections API route](!api!/store#collections_getcollections):

- `limit`: The number of product collections to return in the request.
- `offset`: The number of product collections to skip before the returned product collections. You can calculate this by multiplying the current page with the limit.

The response object returns a `count` field, which is the total count of product collections. Use it to determine whether there are more product collections that can be loaded.

For example:

export const paginateHighlights = [
  ["21", "offset", "Calculate the number of product collections to skip based on the current page and limit."],
  ["27", "count", "The total number of product collections in the Medusa application."],
  ["39", "setHasMorePages", "Set whether there are more pages based on the total count."],
  ["58", "button", "Show a button to load more product collections if there are more pages."]
]

```tsx highlights={paginateHighlights}
"use client" // include with Next.js 13+

import { useEffect, useState } from "react"
import { HttpTypes } from "@medusajs/types"
import { sdk } from "@/lib/sdk"

export default function Collections() {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true)
  const [collections, setCollections] = useState<
    HttpTypes.StoreCollection[]
  >([])
  const limit = 20
  const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(1)
  const [hasMorePages, setHasMorePages] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!loading) {
      return 
    }

    const offset = (currentPage - 1) * limit

    sdk.store.collection.list({
      limit,
      offset,
    })
    .then(({ collections: dataCollections, count }) => {
      setCollections((prev) => {
        if (prev.length > offset) {
          // product collections already added because 
          // the same request has already been sent
          return prev
        }
        return [
          ...prev,
          ...dataCollections,
        ]
      })
      setHasMorePages(count > limit * currentPage)
      setLoading(false)
    })
  }, [loading])

  return (
    <div>
      {loading && <span>Loading...</span>}
      {!loading && collections.length === 0 && (
        <span>No product collections found.</span>
      )}
      {!loading && collections.length > 0 && (
        <ul>
          {collections.map((collection) => (
            <li key={collection.id}>{collection.title}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      )}
      {!loading && hasMorePages && (
        <button 
          onClick={() => {
            setCurrentPage((prev) => prev + 1)
            setLoading(true)
          }}
          disabled={loading}
        >
          Load More
        </button>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

In this example, you paginate the product collections by passing the `limit` and `offset` query parameters to the [List Product Collections API route](!api!/store#collections_getcollections).

Then, you show a button to load more product collections if there are more pages.

## Filter Collections

The [List Product Collections API route](!api!/store#collections_getcollections) accepts query parameters to filter the collections by title, handle, and more.

Refer to the [API reference](!api!/store#collections_getcollections) for the full list of accepted query parameters.

For example, to filter the collections by title:

```ts
sdk.store.collection.list({
  title: "Summer Clothes",
})
.then(({ collections }) => {
  // TODO set collections...
})
```

In this example, only the collections with the title "Summer Clothes" are returned.

---

## Sort Collections

To sort collections by a field, use the `order` query parameter. Its value is a comma-separated list of fields to sort by, and each field is optionally prefixed by `-` to indicate descending order.

For example, to sort collections by title in descending order:

```ts
sdk.store.collection.list({
  order: "-title",
})
.then(({ collections, count }) => {
  // TODO set collections...
})
```

The result will be collections sorted by title in descending order.
