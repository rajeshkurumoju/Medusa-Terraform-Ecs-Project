If you get the following error in your Medusa application's terminal:

```bash
Trying to query by not existing property LinkModel.X.
```

Where `X` is the name of a data model. For example, `LinkModel.cart`.

## Why this Error Occurred

This error occurs when you're using Query and you're trying to filter by a linked module, which isn't allowed.

For example, assuming you have a `Post` data model and you linked it to the `Cart` data model, this isn't allowed:

```ts
const { data } = await query.graph({
  entity: "post",
  fields: ["*"],
  filter: {
    cart: {
      id: "cart_123",
    },
  },
})
```

You can't filter your custom `post` data model by the ID of their linked cart.

---

## How to Fix it

You need to query the link's table directly and apply the filters on its ID columns. For example:

```ts
import PostCartLink from "../links/post-cart"

// ...

const { data } = await query.graph({
  entity: PostCartLink.entryPoint,
  fields: ["post.*", "cart.*"],
  filters: {
    cart_id: "cart_123",
  },
})
```

In the above example, you query the `PostCartLink` data model directly and apply the filters to the `cart_id` field, which holds the ID of the cart linked to the post. You'll then only retrieve the posts linked to the cart with the ID `cart_123`.
