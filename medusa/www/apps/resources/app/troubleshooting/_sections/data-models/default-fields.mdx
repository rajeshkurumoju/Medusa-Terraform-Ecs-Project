If you get the following error after creating a new data model in your Medusa application:

```bash
error:   Error: Cannot define field(s) "created_at,updated_at,deleted_at" as they are implicitly defined on every model
```

The error may include the three fields, or only some of them, based on which fields you're trying to define in the data model.

## Why this Error Occurred

This error occurs because you're trying to define the `created_at`, `updated_at`, or `deleted_at` properties on a new data model. These properties are implicitly defined on every data model in Medusa and can't be redefined.

---

## How to Fix it

To resolve this error, remove the `created_at`, `updated_at`, and `deleted_at` properties from your data model definition. You'll still be able to use these properties in your application, but you can't redefine them in your data models.
