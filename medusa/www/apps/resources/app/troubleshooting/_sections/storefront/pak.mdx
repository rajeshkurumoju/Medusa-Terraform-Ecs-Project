If you receive the following error response when you send a request to a `/store` route:

```json
{
  "type": "not_allowed",
  "message": "Publishable API key required in the request header: x-publishable-api-key. You can manage your keys in settings in the dashboard."
}
```

## Why this Error Occurred

This error occurs because the request is missing the `x-publishable-api-key` header. The `x-publishable-api-key` header is required for all requests to the `/store` route.

---

## How to Fix it

To resolve this error, add the `x-publishable-api-key` header to your request. You can find your publishable API key in the [Medusa Admin Dashboard](!user-guide!/settings/developer/publishable-api-keys).

For example:

```bash
curl -X GET https://localhost:9000/store/products \
  -H "x-publishable-api-key: your-publishable-api-key"
```

Where `your-publishable-api-key` is your publishable API key.
