The Next.js Starter Storefront uses parallel routes to show account pages. However, there's a [reported error](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/71626) when hosting Next.js with parallel routes on Google's Cloud Run, where the error stops working.

## Why this Error Occurred

This error occurs because Google Cloud Run decodes chunk URLs, but Next.js expects them to be encoded.

## How to Fix it

To resolve the error, add the following rewrites in your Next.js Starter Storefront's `next.config.ts` file:

```ts title="next.config.ts"
const nextConfig = {
  // ... other config
  rewrites: async () => {
    return {
      beforeFiles: [
        {
          source: "/_next/static/chunks/app/:folder*/@login/:path*",
          destination: "/_next/static/chunks/app/:folder*/%40login/:path*",
        },
        // Repeat this pattern if other similar errors occur
      ],
      afterFiles: [],
      fallback: [],
    }
  },
}
```

You can add the rewrite to other parallel routes you have in your application. For example, if you have a `/@dashboard` route, you can add a rewrite for it as well.
