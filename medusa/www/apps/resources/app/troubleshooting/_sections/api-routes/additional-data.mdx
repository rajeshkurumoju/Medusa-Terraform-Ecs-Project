If you send a request to an API route and receive the following error:

```json
{
  "type": "invalid_data", 
  "message": "Invalid request: Unrecognized fields: 'additional_data'"
}
```

## Why this Error Occured

This error occurs when you send the `additional_data` request body parameter to a route that doesn't support it.

The [Additional Data property](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/api-routes/additional-data) is useful to pass custom data to an API route, but it's not supported by all API routes.

---

## How to Fix it

For the list of API routes that support passing `additional_data`, refer to the [Additional Data documentation](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/api-routes/additional-data).

If the route you need isn't on the list, you have to create a custom API route with your desired functionality.
