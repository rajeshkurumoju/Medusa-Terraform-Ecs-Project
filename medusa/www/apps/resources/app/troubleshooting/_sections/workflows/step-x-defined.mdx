If you get the following error when you start the Medusa application:

```bash
Error: Step X is already defined in workflow.
```

Where `X` is any step, such as `create-remote-link`.

## Why this Error Occurred

This error indicates that you're re-using a step in a workflow, meaning that more than one step in the workflow have the same name.

---

## How to Fix it

To resolve this error, use the `config` method of a step to specify a custom name within the workflow's scope. For example:

```ts
const helloWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "hello",
  () => {
    const { data: products } = useQueryGraphStep({
      entity: "product",
      fields: ["id"],
    })

    // âœ“ No error occurs, the step has a different ID.
    const { data: customers } = useQueryGraphStep({
      entity: "customer",
      fields: ["id"],
    }).config({ name: "fetch-customers" })
  }
)
```

In the above example, you use the `config` method on the second `useQueryGraphStep` usage to change its name to `fetch-customers`.

Make sure to change the name of every usage after the first one in a workflow.
