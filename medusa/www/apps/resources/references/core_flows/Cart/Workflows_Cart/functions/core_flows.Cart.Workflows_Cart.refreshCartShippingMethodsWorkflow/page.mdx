# refreshCartShippingMethodsWorkflow - Medusa Core Workflows Reference

This documentation provides a reference to the `refreshCartShippingMethodsWorkflow`. It belongs to the `@medusajs/medusa/core-flows` package.

This workflow refreshes a cart's shipping methods, ensuring that their associated shipping options can still be used on the cart,
and retrieve their correct pricing after a cart update. This workflow is used by the [refreshCartItemsWorkflow](../core_flows.Cart.Workflows_Cart.refreshCartItemsWorkflow/page.mdx).

You can use this workflow within your own customizations or custom workflows, allowing you to refresh the cart's shipping method after making updates to the cart.

## Hooks

Hooks allow you to inject custom functionalities into the workflow. You'll receive data from the workflow, as well as additional data sent through an HTTP request.

Learn more about [Hooks](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/workflows/workflow-hooks) and [Additional Data](https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/api-routes/additional-data).

### validate

This hook is executed before all operations. You can consume this hook to perform any custom validation. If validation fails, you can throw an error to stop the workflow execution.

#### Example

```ts
import { refreshCartShippingMethodsWorkflow } from "@medusajs/medusa/core-flows"

refreshCartShippingMethodsWorkflow.hooks.validate(
  (async ({ input, cart }, { container }) => {
    //TODO
  })
)
```

#### Input

Handlers consuming this hook accept the following input.

<TypeList types={[{"name":"input","type":"object","description":"The input data for the hook.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"input","type":"[RefreshCartShippingMethodsWorkflowInput](../../../../types/core_flows.RefreshCartShippingMethodsWorkflowInput/page.mdx)","description":"The details of the cart to refresh.","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[{"name":"cart_id","type":"`string`","description":"The cart's ID.","optional":true,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]},{"name":"cart","type":"`any`","description":"The Cart reference.","optional":true,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]},{"name":"cart","type":"`any`","description":"","optional":false,"defaultValue":"","expandable":false,"children":[]}]}]} expandUrl="https://docs.medusajs.com/learn/fundamentals/data-models/manage-relationships#retrieve-records-of-relation" openedLevel={1} sectionTitle="validate"/>
